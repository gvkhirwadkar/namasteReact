 ●   - What is `NPM`? 
    NPM is a beautiful way which helps you to manage the packages in project !

 ●   - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it? 
    Parcel is a bundler which comes with lot of powers out of the box like minification, HMR, cleaning of code, caching etc.
    You can install it as a dependency in project with command npm install -D parcel

 ●   - What is `.parcel-cache` 
    Caching store where information of project is stored when parcel builds it 
    It is to optimise the build time because second time onwards it does not need to
    re=parse and re-analyse everything from scratch !

 ●   - What is `npx` ? 
    Command to execute something !

 ●   - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies` 
    Dependencies are packages/libraries which are part of your project in some way !
    Now difference between dev dependencies and dependencies is that dev dependencies 
    are only part of development but not in production.

 ●   - What is Tree Shaking? 
    Removal of code which is not being used in project and it relies on the import/export 
    statements to detect of code modules are exported and imported !
    
 ●   - What is Hot Module Replacement? 
    HMR is a technique when your server will reload automatically when you saves any changes in 
    code ! It is done with the help of file watchers.


 ●   - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your 
 own words. 

    Minification - Reduces size of bundle which actually helps in reducing the overall size deployed 
    to browser !
    Image optimisation - Rare, image optimisation is very important and many devs work on this
    to optimise the performance ! Parcel give this out of the box.
    Multiple Port Number support - You can start and listen to server at different ports at the 
    same time !


 ●   - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it? 
    There are sometime when you do not need to commit every file to git which unnecessarily
    increases the size of project, so to exclude files/folder you can actually get it added to
    .gitignore file and it will be skipped while adding in changes !

 ●   - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` 
    package.json depicts your overall project, it is the heart of project. It contains meta data, 
    scripts and more importantly it has section of dependencies where it contains packages with version
    number on which project runs.

    lock.json is a snapshot when packages are installed and it tells the current 
    version of package used in production. It also make sure that no inconsistency happens in 
    package versions !

 ●   - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`? 
    Lock file contains the current version of package used in production and it should not be modified

 ●   - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git? 

    Node modules are packages which are needed for your project in order to run !
    No you should not push it on git because of their size and number !
    
 ●   - What is the `dist` folder? 

    dist folder is basically a directory created after your project is built and all the files
    deployed on browser will be there.

 ●   - What is `browserlists` 
    The browserslist configuration controls the outputted JavaScript so that the emitted 
    code will be compatible with the browsers specified.
